# Santander-customer-transaction-classification-problem
Santander UK is one of the leading personal financial services companies in the United Kingdom, and one of the largest providers of mortgages and savings in this country. They are always looking for ways to help the customers understand their financial health and identify which products and services might help them achieve their monetary goals. In this project, I have addressed Santander customer transaction classification problem. It is a part of competition initiated by Santander in Kaggle. The aim of the project is to identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted.
